===================================================================

										step 1
the bronze.erp_loc_a101 have a relationship with the cleaned bronze.crm_cust_info(silver.crm_cust_info)
the relationship is the cid column in erp_loc_a101 table and cst_key column in crm_cust_info table
after check, the cid need to be clean and have the same value with cst_key using replace()

=====================================================================

											step 2
check accuracy of the cntry column
use CASE WHEN to asign normal value to the wrong value

after that, then insert the cleaned data into the silver.erp_loc_a101 table
